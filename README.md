# Student Scribble

# Demo: 'https://student-scribble-app.herokuapp.com/'

## The User's

When deciding upon the purpose of my App, I considered creating something that will make it easier for students to keep track of
homework, assignemnts and projects. I idea is that Students will be able to create accounts and log in each time. They will be able
to create a list of subjects and then seelct a subject to write a note on. For example, they could create a note that will remond them of what homework
they have to do for a particular subject, they will be able to select a date and weather or not the note is compete.
The student will be able to edit notes as they go and delete them once complete.

   - The Footer Links are indented inwards, and I have hidden some text on Mobile and Tablet Screens for display purposes.

     Google Chrome, Safari, Firefox and Internet Explorer.

## Acknowledgment: 
     I received inspiration for this project from my partner Natasha Thompson (Tash). Tash is a  
     Teacher in Bray and was always complaining that the children are never organised with 
     Homework/Notes Etc
     I would also like to thank my mentor Guido . His support throughout has been
     of great assistance. 
     Lastly, I would like to acknowledge my dad who encouraged me to start this course in the 
     pursuit of bettering my career prospects.
